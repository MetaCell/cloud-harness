## Create a default Frontend with React and Openapi

Can use a webapp application template, see [here](../harness-application.md).

## Authentication and Authorization

The preferred method is to use and configure a [gatekeeper](../../accounts#configure-a-gatekeeper).

Another option is using the [Keycloak Javascript adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keycloak-js).
