# Cluster configuration

Cloud Harness deploys with helm and uses an ingress controller to serve application endpoints.

The ingress controller is not installed as a part of the application, and has to be installed separately. The imstallation process can be different depending on the Kubernetes provider.

See [here](../../infrastructure/cluster-configuration/README.md) for more information and resources for setting up your cluster.
