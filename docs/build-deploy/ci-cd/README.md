# CI/CD with CloudHarness

CloudHarness supports continuous deployment natively by creating the Helm Chart for you and with a few 
ways to build containers.

## CI/CD with Skaffold

[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) is a command line tool that simplifies build and deployment  on a Kubernetes cluster. The configuration as `skaffold.yaml` file is created when running
`harness-deployment`.

All you need to to is:
- Configure the Kubernetes cluster in your local shell (e.g. `gcloud init` on Google Cloud)
- Configure the local Docker to be able to push to the remote registry
- Create the deployment specifying the registry and remote domain -- `harness-deployment ... -r myregistry -d mydomain`
- Run `skaffold build`
- Run `skaffold run`

## CI/CD with Codefresh

[Codefresh](https://codefresh.io/) is a nice platform for CI/CD see details in the [dedicated document](./codefresh.md).
