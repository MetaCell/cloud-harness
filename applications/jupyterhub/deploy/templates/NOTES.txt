Thank you for installing JupyterHub!

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }} and installed into the namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}.

You can find if the hub and proxy is ready by doing:

 kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get pod

and watching for both those pods to be in status 'Running'.

You can find the public IP of the JupyterHub by doing:

 kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get svc proxy-public

It might take a few minutes for it to appear!

{{- if .Values.apps.jupyterhub.hub.extraConfigMap }}

DEPRECATION: hub.extraConfigMap is deprecated in jupyterhub chart 0.8.
Use top-level `custom` instead:

---
custom:
{{- (merge dict .Values.apps.jupyterhub.custom .Values.apps.jupyterhub.hub.extraConfigMap) | toYaml | nindent 2}}
---
{{- end }}

{{- if and (not .Values.apps.jupyterhub.scheduling.podPriority.enabled) (and .Values.apps.jupyterhub.scheduling.userPlaceholder.enabled .Values.apps.jupyterhub.scheduling.userPlaceholder.replicas) }}

WARNING: You are using user placeholders without pod priority enabled, either
enable pod priority or stop using the user placeholders to avoid wasting cloud
resources.
